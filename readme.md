# Flow to Typescript

## Usage:

`npm install -g flowts`

```
Usage: flowts [options] ./path/to/project

Flow to TypeScript migration tool

Options:
  -V, --version                output the version number
  -R, --no-recast              use babel generator instead of recast
  -P, --no-prettier            do not run prettier on converted code
  --no-allow-js                convert all JS files to TypeScript(including without Flow)
  --no-remove                  keep js files after appropriate ts files were created
  --just-rename                just rename the files; don't convert them
  --in-place                   convert files in place without renaming them
  -i, --include <includeGlob>  Glob expression of files to include, default: "**/*.{js,mjs,jsx,js.flow}" (default: "**/*.{js,mjs,jsx,js.flow}")
  -x, --exclude <excludeGlob>  Additional excludes glob expression (by default node_modules and files from .gitignore is excluded) (default: "**/node_modules/**")
  -h, --help                   output usage information

```

## How it works

1. Convert source code using: https://github.com/zxbodya/babel-plugin-flow-to-typescript
2. Does some additional fixes for types embeded in flow library (for example react types are somewhat different from typescript version)
3. Prints code using recast (https://github.com/benjamn/recast), so most of the formatting is preserved.
4. Because not all formatting can be preserved - it also reformats code using prettier (assumption is that converted codebase is using it, and there is configured in standard way, like having `.prettierrc`). Also be sure you already have prettier 2.0 (it needed for TypeScript 3.8)
5. Before writing converted file - script verifies that there are no changes other then type annotations (all errors are logged - so, be sure to check logs and to adjustments accordingly)

## Project priorities

1. Only type annotation should be changed, so code after migration is in "working" state
2. Type information should be preserved as much as possible
3. When possible formatting and comments should be preseved

## Cavearts

There might be unexpected formatting changes, or bugs related to using recast - it is good, but there can be bugsâ€¦

Rarely, but sometimes:

- there might be unexpected formatting changes
- some comments might be removed
